                <h2>RETALIATION / WHISTLEBLOWERS</h2>
            Employees may not be retaliated against for reporting misconduct in the workplace, 
            including mistreatment of other employees and illegal business practices by the 
            employer.
            

California law prohibits employment retaliation and provides significant penalties for employees 
            who engage in such activity.  The Fair Employment and Housing Act (known as “FEHA”) 
            prohibits an employer from retaliating against any person who has “opposed any 
            practices” prohibited by FEHA or who has filed a complaint or testified or assisted 
            in any legal proceeding under FEHA.   (Government Code § 12940(h).)
            

FEHA’s retaliation provision applies to “employers,” which is defined as “any person regularly 
            employing five or more persons, or any person acting as an agent of an employer.”
            (Government Cod §§12926(d), 12940(h).)  FEHA claims can also be made against labor 
            organizations and employment agencies.  (Government Code § 12940(h).)

In addition to FEHA, Labor Code § 98.6(a) prohibits an employer from discriminating, 
            retaliating, or taking any adverse action (for example firing, demoting, threatening 
            to fire, suspending, failing to hire, failing to select for a training program 
            leading to employment) against an employee or applicant for doing any of the 
            following:

Engaging in conduct described in Labor Code §§ 79–107 (e.g., engaging in political activities);
Filing a lawsuit or complaint with the Labor Commissioner;
Making a written or oral complaint that the employee is owed unpaid wages;
Filing an action or notice under Labor Code § 2699, California’s Private Attorneys General Act 
            of 2004 (known as “PAGA”), or testifying or being about to testify in a PAGA 
            proceeding;
Exercising any rights under the Labor Code.
As a potential whistleblower, you should consult with an attorney to help you consider your 
            options and the potential consequences of reporting misconduct by your employer.  
            Lebe Law will advise you on the variety of laws that protect employees against being 
            fired, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or otherwise retaliated against for 
            complaining about or reporting illegal activity.<br><br>
